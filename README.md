# whatsapp-automation-using-selenium

This project is an automation app that allows you to send messages on WhatsApp using the Selenium and PyAutoGUI libraries.

## Project Description

The app consists of three Python scripts:

1. `main.py`: This script utilizes the PyAutoGUI and Selenium libraries to automate sending messages on WhatsApp. It opens WhatsApp Web, selects a contact, and sends a message using text input from the user.

2. `test.py`: This script demonstrates how to read data from a CSV file using the pandas library. It reads a CSV file containing a list of contacts and messages, and sends the messages to the respective contacts on WhatsApp.

3. `1st.py`: This script demonstrates an alternative approach to automate sending messages on WhatsApp using only the Selenium library. It opens WhatsApp Web, selects a contact, and sends a predefined message.

## Dependencies

Make sure you have the following dependencies installed:

- Python 3.x
- Selenium
- PyAutoGUI
- Pandas

You can install the required dependencies using the following command:

```shell
pip install selenium pyautogui pandas

## Usage

1. Set up the appropriate drivers for Selenium based on your browser choice (e.g., chromedriver for Google Chrome).

2. Run the desired Python script (main.py, test.py, or 1st.py) using Python.

3. Follow the instructions prompted by the app to provide necessary inputs such as contacts, messages, or specific URLs to send.

4. The app will automate the process of opening WhatsApp Web, selecting contacts, and sending messages as per the provided inputs.

Please refer to the individual script files for more details on their usage and functionality.
